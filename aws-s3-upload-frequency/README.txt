For the tool description consult the docstring of the script

Initial setup (one time):
    * Create virtual environment (copy) of Python3
        > python3 -m venv ./p3env
    * Activate new virtual environment
        > source ./p3env/bin/activate
    * Install dependencies
        > pip install -r requirements.txt

The first time you run the script it will be slow as Python pre-compiles newly installed modules
