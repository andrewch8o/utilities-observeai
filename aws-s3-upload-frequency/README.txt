This tool runs as a Jupyter Notebook.

Prerequisites
* Install Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual 
    -- ( you don't need to register, download starts right away )

    You can think of Anaconda as a separate copy of Python with whole
    bunch of stuff on top of it for data analysis purposes

* Start Anaconda Navigator ( from Applications ) and launch button 
    under the Jupyter Notebook

    -- this will open a browser window ( jupyter notebook runs as a local
    web server with UI available via a new browser window that should have
    been opened automatically)
    -- you can connect to jypyter server running locally opening 
    the http://localhost:8888/tree in a browser window

* In the Jupyter Notebook UI in the browser navigate to the folder
    containing the files in this repository and open the notebook
    by clicking on the *.ipynb file
